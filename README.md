# Wappler Project Cleanup Tool

Interactive CLI tool to identify and safely cleanup unused resources in your Wappler projects.

## Features

- 🔍 **Smart Detection**: Finds unused server actions in `/app/api/` and `/app/lib/`
- 🛣️ **Dead Routes Detection**: Finds routes in `routes.json` that reference missing files
- 🎯 **Multi-Pattern Scanning**: Detects references in HTML, EJS, JSON, and JavaScript files
- 🔗 **Queue-Aware**: Identifies Bull queue `api_file` references (critical for background jobs)
- 📁 **Empty Folder Cleanup**: Detects and removes empty directories
- 🎮 **Interactive by Default**: User-friendly interface for safe cleanup
- 📊 **Confidence Levels**: Safe-to-delete vs review-needed scoring
- 💾 **Backup System**: Automatic backup before deletion
- 📈 **Detailed Reports**: Export results to JSON or HTML

## Installation

### Global Installation (Recommended)
```bash
npm install -g wappler-cleanup-tool
```

### One-time Usage (No Installation)
```bash
npx wappler-cleanup-tool
```

## Usage

### Interactive Mode (Default)
```bash
cd /path/to/your/wappler/project
wappler-cleanup
```

### Non-Interactive Mode
```bash
# Just show results
wappler-cleanup --non-interactive

# Export to JSON
wappler-cleanup --non-interactive --output results.json

# Specify project directory
wappler-cleanup --project-root /path/to/wappler/project
```

## Layered-confidence workflow (for production deletion)

Static analysis alone can have false positives on runtime-dispatched code (queue modules, middleware-registered routes). For high-stakes deletion, layer in prod telemetry and a canary step:

```bash
# One-shot: static + Better Stack 90d + test grep
wappler-cleanup scan --full --output report.json

# Promote "stageable" items into deletion-candidates.json on the target repo
wappler-cleanup stage --report report.json --target ~/path/to/app

# After the soak window (7/14/30 days based on risk tier):
wappler-cleanup verify-canary --target ~/path/to/app
wappler-cleanup delete --target ~/path/to/app --confirmed
```

Requires:
- `BETTERSTACK_TOKEN` env var (for Signal 2 + canary queries)
- `BETTERSTACK_TABLE` env var (or pass `--betterstack-table <table>` to each command) — the Better Stack source table for your app's HTTP logs
- The target app must have the canary-logger middleware installed (writes `CANARY_HIT` events for any path listed in its `deletion-candidates.json`).

## How It Works

### 1. Discovery Phase
- **Server Actions**: Scans `/app/api/**/*.json` and `/app/lib/**/*.json` for files with `exec` or `steps`
- **Dead Routes**: Scans `app/config/routes.json` for routes pointing to missing files
- **Empty Folders**: Detects directories that can be safely removed

### 2. Reference Detection
The tool looks for these patterns:

**HTML/EJS Files:**
- `url="/api/v1/courses/create"`
- `action="/api/v1/security/login"`

**JSON Files (Critical for Queues):**
- `"api_file": "/app/api/v1/queues/integrations/mailerlite/sync/..."`
- `"exec": "lib/security/check"`
- `"module": "core"`

**JavaScript Files:**
- `fetch('/api/v1/courses')`
- `url: '/api/v1/users'`

### 3. Confidence Scoring
- **Safe to Delete**: No references found - likely safe to delete
- **Review Needed**: References found - manual review required

### 4. Interactive Features
- 📋 View all actions with status indicators
- 🔍 Detailed view with references and file content
- ☑️ Multi-select actions for deletion
- 🗂️ Empty folder detection and cleanup
- 🚨 Confirmation prompts with backup options
- 💾 Export results for team review

## Safety Features

- **Dry Run Default**: Shows what would be deleted without actually deleting
- **Backup System**: Creates timestamped backups before deletion
- **Confidence Levels**: Clear indicators of deletion safety
- **Interactive Confirmation**: Multiple confirmation steps for deletion
- **Detailed Logging**: See exactly what references were found

## Example Output

## Use Cases

- **Project Maintenance**: Keep your Wappler project clean and organized
- **Performance**: Remove unused code that might affect build times or deployment size

## Edge Cases Handled

- **Queue Jobs**: Detects `api_file` references in Bull queue definitions
- **Dynamic References**: Identifies computed API paths in JavaScript
- **Library Actions**: Finds `lib/` references in exec statements
- **Webhook Actions**: Scans webhook handlers for API calls
- **Schedule Jobs**: Checks cron job definitions
- **Nested Empty Folders**: Recursively finds and handles empty directory trees

## Configuration

Create an `ignore-list.json` file in your project root to exclude specific paths:

```json
{
  "ignored": [
    "/api/dev-test",
    "/api/template-*",
    "lib/shared/utilities"
  ]
}
```

## Warning

Always review results carefully before deletion. The tool is designed to be safe, but:
- Some actions might be referenced dynamically in ways not detectable by static analysis
- Environment-specific actions might be needed in production but not development
- Create backups and test thoroughly after cleanup
